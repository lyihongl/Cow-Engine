## COW ENGINE ##

To build:


Please ensure that SDL2 is installed, along with the Image package. Modify the make file so that it points to your install of SDL2


This engine is being designed with only Windows in mind, as it is just a side thing for me, currently nothing should stop you from building on \*nix systems but that may change in the future.


The engine will be a 2D sprite engine. Part of this project is for me to learn, so maybe more advanced features will be added in the future.
